This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, Car.java,  
which extends the abstract Vehicle class. The Car class contains the following:

- Two instance variables  
- A parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables  
- Getters for the instance variables in this class  
- The toString method  
- The equals method  
- A copy method
